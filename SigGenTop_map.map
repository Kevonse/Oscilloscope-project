WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator U1/U5/Mmux_DataN_31 failed to merge
   with F5 multiplexer U1/U5/Mmux_DataN_2_f5_2.  There is a conflict for the
   FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal timing.

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    1
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:           164 out of   1,920    8%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:               278 out of   1,920   14%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:            206 out of     960   21%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:     206 out of     206 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of     206   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:         312 out of   1,920   16%
    Number used as logic:               278
    Number used as a route-thru:         34

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 28 out of      83   33%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       1
  Number of RAMB16s:                      2 out of       4   50%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of      24    4%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.27

Peak Memory Usage:  290 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  1 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   1 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
